# ES6 Weather App
Simple pure ES6 weather app
Done to challenge myself (3 effective hours to make a small app)

Based on https://github.com/sweetcoco/webpack-babel-boilerplate.git and OpenWeather

## Launch
```
git clone https://github.com/AnicetR/es6-weather-app.git es6-weather-app
cd es6-weather-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

TODO :
